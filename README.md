# CheatHelper
This is just an Android app I made in my free time.
As I'm a (pretty good) student my friends sometimes(Read: almost always) ask me to help them by messaging the answers. Using this app you can send an SMS(the answers of course) straight from the Lock Screen. Best of all, it's diguised as a regular Lock Screen protected by Pin.
Many thanks to Adenda SDK(http://www.adendamedia.com/) and @codinguser for his contact picker library.
